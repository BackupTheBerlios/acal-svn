ACal - Web Calendar


## Installing From Command Line ##

 1) Run the configure script: ./configure
	It will check to make sure everything is working and ask you a few questions.
 2) Copy the calendar folder to your document root.
 3) Go to it in your web browser. Example: http://localhost/calendar/


## Installing on a Remote FTP Server ##

 1) If you have command line access run the configure script.
	If you do not, open configuration.xml in a plain text editor.
	Change whatever you need to. See the Configuration section below.
 2) Upload the calendar folder to your web server using your FTP client.
 3) Go to it in your web browser. Example: http://my.host.tld/calendar/

## Configuration.xml ##

<db/> What database the calendar should use. Currently sqlite and mysqli are supported.

<sqlite_path/> If you are using SQLite which is default, this tells ACal where to store
	the database files. The default value of UNDER_DOCUMENT_ROOT should work fine if
	you compiled and installed Apache2 from source using the default settings.

<mysqli_host/> The domain or IP address of the server hosting MySQL. Usually 127.0.0.1 or localhost is fine.

<mysqli_username/> Username needed for accessing the MySQL server.

<mysqli_password/> Password needed for accessing the MySQL server.

## Notes ##

PHP 5.0.0 or later is required.
If you want to use MySQL, you must be using MySQL 4.1 or later with mysqli enabled in PHP via the --with-mysqli configure flag.
SQLite is enabled by default on all PHP 5 installations, but requires that you set the path to a folder writable
by your web server. For example the user nobody or in some cases www must have write access to the folder defined in sqlite_path.

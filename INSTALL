ACal - Web Calendar


## Installing From Command Line ##

 1) Run the configure script: ./configure
	It will check to make sure everything is working and ask you a few questions.
 2) Copy the calendar folder to your document root.
 3) Go to it in your web browser. Example: http://localhost/calendar/


## Installing on Remote FTP Server ##

 1) If you have command line access run the configure script.
	If you do not, open configuration.xml in a plain text editor.
	Change whatever you need to.
 2) Upload the calendar folder to your web server using your FTP client.
 3) Go to it in your web browser. Example: http://my.host.tld/calendar/

## Configuration.xml ##

<db/> What database the calendar should use. Currently sqlite and mysqli are supported.

<sqlite_path/> If you are using SQLite which is default. This tells ACal where to store
	the database files. The default value of UNDER_DOCUMENT_ROOT should work fine if
	you compiled and installed Apache from source using default settings.

<mysqli_host/> The address of the server hosting MySQL. Usually 127.0.0.1 or localhost is fine.

<mysqli_username/> Username for accessing the MySQL server.

<mysqli_password/> Password for accessing the MySQL server.

## Notes ##

PHP 5.0.0 or later is required.
If you want to use MySQL, you must be using MySQL 4.1 or later with mysqli enabled in PHP via the --with-mysqli configure flag.
SQLite is enabled by default on all PHP 5 installations, but requires that you set the path to a folder writable
by your web server or PHP.
